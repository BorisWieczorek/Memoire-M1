<p>Participation in this study is entirely voluntary, and may be withdrawn at any given moment without further consequences. Your decisions will be made anonymously. The results will be analyzed at the individual level for publications in scientific journals. However, it will be impossible to link your identity to your decisions or to your answers on the questionnaire. </p>

<p><strong>Payment :</strong> A flat fee of $0.5 plus a bonus that depends on your decisions.</p>

<p>The experiment has 3 parts plus a short questionnaire at the end. You need to complete the 3 parts to be eligible for the bonus payment.  At the end of the experiment, the computer will randomly select one of the three parts and your choices in that part will determine your final gains from the experiment. </p>

<p> The experiment takes less than 10 minutes to be completed. </p>

<p><strong>Informed consent :</strong> By accepting to participate in this experiment, you give us informed consent that we can use your answers in anonymized form for research purposes only.
