    <p> In this task, you need to choose between two options, option A and option B. For each row, you need to choose whether you prefer to take the option A or the option B. For example, in the first row, option A gives you $2 with a probability of 10% and $1.60 with a probability of 90%, while choosing option B would give you $3.85  with a probability of 10% and $0.10 with a probability of 90%. </p>

    <p>For each row, the probabilities are different. At the end, the computer will randomly select one row and your gain in this part will correspond to the choice youâ€™ve made in that row. </p>
